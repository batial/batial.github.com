# JAP E-Commerce
This project was part of my course at Jóvenes a Programar 2022 (UY), where I learned the basics of web development.
During the development of this project, I encountered some difficulties that helped me improve my skills. I added a feature that allows users to log in using their Google account with the help of Firebase. Additionally, I included a shopping cart where users can put items and proceed to the checkout section.
